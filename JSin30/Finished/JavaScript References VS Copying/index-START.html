    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const copy = []
    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    players.forEach(player => {
      copy.push(player);
    })

    console.log(copy);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    copy[2] = 'Jack';

    console.log(players);
    console.log(copy);
     //now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const copy2 = players.slice();
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const copy3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const copy4 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    const copy5 = Array.from(players);
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const mvp = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 21});
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    console.log(person);
    console.log(mvp);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const mvp2 = {...person}; soonTM
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
